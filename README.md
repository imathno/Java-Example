# Creating Community Small Groups
A work by: Issah Mathno and Trent Howell

Small groups are a staple of many churches aroung the globe, however disputes always seem to surface over the structure and scheduling of these meetings.
So what if a more automated system existed that can schedule these groups with a particular criteria in mind? *write an introduction to your project*

## Description
Our project is about creating a schedule of small groups that ensures that every person in the system visits everyone else's house who is in the system. By creating a list of lists of small groupings we can perfectly distribute the load of hosting responsibilities to every person in the small group system. We decided to implement our solution using Java and the jgrapht graph implementation.
*Describe what your project is about and what language you used*

## User Manual
*Once a person clones this into their computer how the person is supposed to run the program, add screenshots showing how your program works, also add here the link to the Youtube video showing the program running*

## Reflection
*Write the reflection about getting the small groups in the minimum number of iterations, etc.*
